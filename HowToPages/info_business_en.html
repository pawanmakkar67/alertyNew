				<div class='bC'>
					<p>When you send an alert, a message is sent to one or more contacts you’ve chosen earlier.</p>
					<p>The message contains an URL that provides your contacts with a map, that’s updated every 10 seconds and shows your current location. The camera is recording during the time the alert is active. The alert is also visible for the administrator on the website your business account is connected to. Please note that Alerty is a silent alarm, no audible signal will sound when activated.</p>

					<p>You can activate Alerty by using a bluetooth handsfree. In this menu you can chose to activate this features, as well as conduct a test to see whether your handsfree works or not.</p>
					<p>By pressing “Test headset” you’re starting a test where you can make sure that your handsfree works and are compatible with Alerty. Please note that not all bluetooth handsfrees are supported by Alerty, it’s highly recommended that you conduct a test the first time you connect a new handsfree.</p>

				<div class='bT'>Indoor locationing</div>
				<div class='bC'>
					<p>When you’re inside a building it can be difficult for the iPhones GPS to acquire an exact position. To improve your positions accuracy in these situations you can connect to a wireless network. You can then set the location of this wireless network and where you are on a map.</p>
					<p>When you add a new wireless network you can add a description for this position. The description should describe where the network is located with as few words as possible.</p>
					<p>For example: "Apartment number 25" or "Office floor 2".</p>
